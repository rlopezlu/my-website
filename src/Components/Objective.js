      <p>I am looking for my first full time software development job. I have
        experience working with multiple parts of the javascript web dev stack
        using Node.js and compatible npm repos. Angular, React, and Vue are very
        powerful frameworks that I have spent a lot of time with. I have worked with
        mongodb and postgresql. Firebase was great for prototyping since it provided
      a cloud server and database.</p>
